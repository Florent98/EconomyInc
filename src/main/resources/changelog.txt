 + You can now add 5 friends to your vault, and they can open it and share their stuff with you.
 + Same for the 2x2 vault.

 + For the new feature above, the other player must be near you and in the same world or the GUI won't detect him.
 + Added packet of every bills, 9 bills will now give you a packet.
 + Added a new model and new texture for the block vault, if there are some stuff inside, the block change texture inside and contain some bills and gold bar. This will be a future implementation for the animation of the vault.
 + Huge modification, money is now saved in a capabality on server side, which mean that player in multiplayer don't have the amount of money stored on client, but at every connection this data is synchronized from server to client.
   It is a huge modification, because, first there is only one money capabality, so on every credit card that the player will create, he'll have the same amount, the amount of his capabaility stored on server. Second, this is way more secure that way, the client don't send
   anymore packets to server to notify of the change, but that's the server who will notify the client. That way only server can modify the value, and administrators if they have the right tool to read the files and modify it. In singleplayer it works the same way but with the internal server of the game,
   as you may know, when connecting to your client world, you launch a internal server that handle lots of stuff.
 + Command balance will now return the capability of the player and it's not necessary for the player to have his card in the inventory to check it.
 + You can now leave your card in your safe if you have the wireless upgrade. You can directly pay by clicking on buy. Capabilities will handle the change of amount and will synchronize it with your credit card.

 + Added AI to the informer, he acts just like a villager but he is not one, he actually don't like them.
 + Added MySQL. This is a huge add, on the server configuration file you can now allow the server to connect to your database. When the server start you will have a message saying if the database was created 
   successfully or if there is already one it will give you an error message which is normal. 
 + Added when a player connect to the server and if he is not registered it will do it and will put his status on ONLINE.
 + Added when the player disconnect from the server, the money will sync up and his status will be put on OFFLINE.

 @ WARNING : Use the last column with precautions, it should be used in rare case AT THE MOMENT. I'm not responsible for the damage it could cause to your database in any case.
